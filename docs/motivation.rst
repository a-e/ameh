Motivation
==========

This project was born out of recurring annoyances with Atlassian products, specifically:

- Lack of ``init.d`` service scripts to allow automatic startup at boot time
- Non-standard and scattered configuration files and formats
- Inconsistently-named and -located executables for starting and stopping servers
- Too many user accounts created (jira1, jira2 etc.) when installing

The name "ameh" came from "atlas meh", which you could see as a synonym for
"atlas shrug" if you're into that sort of thing. If you like acronyms, you
could think of it as "Atlassian MaintenanceE Helper". The goal of this project
is to make me (and possibly others) have a "meh, no problem" attitude towards
Atlassian product maintenance, instead of the "please fire me and put me out of
my misery" attitude that I have now.
