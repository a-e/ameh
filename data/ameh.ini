# ameh.ini

# This file is for configuring all the Atlassian products that ameh should know
# about. It should be installed in a system-wide location such as /etc/ameh.ini.

# There is one section for each Atlassian application; within each section, you
# can define several "properties" of that application, including the installation
# and home directories, paths for configuration and log files, and so on.

# Within a section, you can reference other properties using a ``%(prop)s`` syntax.
# For example:
#
#   [jira]
#   home = /var/atlassian/application-data/jira-home
#   db = %(home)s/dbconfig.xml
