ameh
====

Tools for managing a set of [Atlassian](http://www.atlassian.com) product installations.


Motivation
----------

This project was born out of recurring annoyances with Atlassian products, specifically:

- Lack of `init.d` service scripts to allow automatic startup at boot time
- Non-standard and scattered configuration files and formats
- Inconsistently-named and -located executables for starting and stopping servers

The name "ameh" came from "atlas meh", which you could see as a synonym for
"atlas shrug" if you're into that sort of thing.
