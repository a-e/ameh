Tools for managing a set of [Atlassian](http://www.atlassian.com) product installations.


Motivation
----------

This project was born out of recurring annoyances with Atlassian products, specifically:

- Lack of `init.d` service scripts to allow automatic startup at boot time
- Non-standard and scattered configuration files and formats
- Inconsistently-named and -located executables for starting and stopping servers
- Too many user accounts created (jira1, jira2 etc.) when installing

The name "ameh" came from "atlas meh", which you could see as a synonym for
"atlas shrug" if you're into that sort of thing. The goal of this project is to
make me (and possibly others) have a "meh, no problem" attitude towards
Atlassian product maintenance, instead of the "please fire me and put me out of
my misery" attitude that I have now.


Ideas
-----

Some tools that it might be worthwhile to include:

- init.d scripts, autogenerated based on configured install/home directories
- Backup scripts
- Symlinking scripts, making configuration files and logs easier to manage by
  having them all in one place (preferably somewhere standard like `/etc` and
  `/var/log`)
- User/group maintainer to prevent multiple jira1, jira2 users from being
  created, and to run each service as a dedicated user

Will probably need:

- A single configuration file to define which Atlassian products you have
  installed, where their install/home directories are, what database backend
  you're using, etc.
- A nice wrapper executable that can be installed system-wide


Usage
-----

How it might be used (not implemented yet):

Install init.d scripts:

    $ ameh init jira
    $ ameh init confluence
    $ ameh init all

Display configuration settings:

    $ ameh config
    jira install: /opt/atlassian/jira
    jira home: /var/atlassian/application-data/jira-home
    confluence install: /opt/atlassian/confluence
    confluence home: /var/atlassian/application-data/confluence-home

Display the names of configuration files:

    $ ameh config jira db
    /var/atlassian/application-data/jira-home/dbconfig.xml

    $ ameh config confluence crowd
    /opt/atlassian/confluence/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/crowd.properties

Edit the Jira DB config file:

    $ vim `ameh config jira db`

Create a new configuration setting for Jira's log4j.properties:

    $ ameh config jira log4j /opt/atlassian/jira/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties

    $ ameh config jira log4j
    /opt/atlassian/jira/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties

Display the name of the log file for Jira:

    $ ameh log jira
    /opt/atlassian/jira/logs/catalina.out

Tail Jira's log file:

    $ tail -f `ameh log jira`

View Atlassian users and their groups:

    $ ameh user
    jira : jira atlas
    confluence : confluence atlas
    crowd : crowd atlas

Backup Jira (installation and home directories):

    $ ameh backup jira
