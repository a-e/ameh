Tools for managing a set of [Atlassian](http://www.atlassian.com) product installations.


Motivation
----------

This project was born out of recurring annoyances with Atlassian products, specifically:

- Lack of `init.d` service scripts to allow automatic startup at boot time
- Non-standard and scattered configuration files and formats
- Inconsistently-named and -located executables for starting and stopping servers
- Too many user accounts created (jira1, jira2 etc.) when installing

The name "ameh" came from "atlas meh", which you could see as a synonym for
"atlas shrug" if you're into that sort of thing. The goal of this project is to
make me (and possibly others) have a "meh" attitude towards Atlassian product
maintenance, instead of the "please fire me and put me out of my misery"
attitude that I have now.


Ideas
-----

Some tools that it might be worthwhile to include:

- init.d scripts, autogenerated based on configured install/home directories
- Backup scripts
- Symlinking scripts, making configuration files and logs easier to manage by
  having them all in one place (preferably somewhere standard like `/etc` and
  `/var/log`)
- User/group maintainer to prevent multiple jira1, jira2 users from being
  created, and to run each service as a dedicated user

Will probably need:

- A single configuration file to define which Atlassian products you have
  installed, where their install/home directories are, what database backend
  you're using, etc.
- A nice wrapper executable that can be installed system-wide
